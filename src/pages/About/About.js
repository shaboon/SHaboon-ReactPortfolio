        <p className="">
          I grew up in Greensboro NC and lived there for 23 years. From a young
          age, I have always been drawn to technology and seeked ways to break
          into the area. As I grew older, I moved toward mechanical engineering
          and physical science. Finally to start my professional career, I took
          an apprenticeship and studied my field while obtaining professional
          skills. However, something was always missing, that being the
          attachtment to technology. For that reason, I decided to fuel my
          desired lifestyle by changing my career to software development. I
          have since finished my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at UNC
          Chapel Hill and am now looking for a job in the field.
